# Gregorian-Calender
A simple C-based Gregorian Calendar Generator by Team Segmentation Fault. It takes user input for year and month (or all months) and displays the calendar with correct leap year handling and weekday calculation. Useful for scheduling and planning, it includes test cases for accuracy and edge case validation.

Sure! Here's the GitHub project description in paragraph format, suitable for your `README.md` or project overview section:

This project is a console-based **Gregorian Calendar Generator** developed in the C programming language as part of a bootcamp on *Critical Thinking & Problem Solving*. Created by the team **Segmentation Fault**, the program allows users to generate a calendar view for a specific month or the entire year based on the Gregorian calendar system. It includes core functionalities such as leap year detection, month-wise day calculation, and accurate determination of the day of the week for any given date. The application uses a reference epoch year (1970) to compute total elapsed days and outputs the calendar layout accordingly.

The primary goal of this project is to help users efficiently plan and organize their schedules by providing an accurate and easy-to-use calendar interface via the terminal. Users can input a specific year and either choose a particular month (1–12) or select "ALL" to view all twelve months of that year. The application handles edge cases like invalid year or month inputs, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

The Gregorian Calendar Generator finds application in various domains such as personal planning, academic scheduling, professional task management, travel coordination, health tracking, and even financial organization. It supports both short-term and long-term planning needs. The codebase is implemented entirely in C without any external libraries, emphasizing fundamental programming logic and date computation techniques.

A comprehensive set of test cases is included to validate correct behavior, such as leap year handling (e.g., 2020 as a leap year and 2100 as not), month length accuracy, and correct identification of the day of the week. Invalid input scenarios are also tested to ensure robust performance.

The project was collaboratively developed by the team members Nandini Hegde, Marushka Rachelle D’silva, Nischal K, Riyaz K, Sujal Revankar, Vikas M, and Yashita Vasu. This tool serves as a useful command-line utility for any user who wishes to view or plan their schedule using a custom-built, lightweight calendar system in C.
